# Thinking-in-React
State is like a component's personal memory and it holds data that can change over time and directly affects what appears on the screen. When I update the state, React automatically re-renders that component to reflect the new data. On the other hand, props are like parameters that a parent component passes to its children. They are read-only, which means a child component receives them as fixed inputs and doesn't change them. This clear separation helps me build components that are both reusable and predictable, keeping the data flow straightforward and easier to debug.
